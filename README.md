# Todoey - My First To-Do List App

This project is a simple to-do list app I built using Xcode.

## Features

* **`State Variables`:** The `todos` array is managed using the `@State` property wrapper, allowing the UI to update when the array changes.
* **`List` and `ForEach`:** The `List` view displays the tasks, and `ForEach` iterates through the `todos` array to create list items.
* **`TextField`:** Used for adding new tasks and editing existing tasks.
* **`Button`:** Used for toggling task completion and adding new tasks.
